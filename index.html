This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel…
<ul><li>I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
</li>
<li>None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying ‘Know the Lord.’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.
</li>
<li>I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.       Hebrews 8:10-12 NKJV</li>
</ul>
<p>“I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” 
Matthew 11:25-30 NKJV</p>

<p>“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. 
Matthew 28:18-20 NKJV</p>
