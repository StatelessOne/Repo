<h3>THIS IS THE COVENANT</h3>
<p>• I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</p>
<p>• None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying ‘Know the Lord.’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</p>
<p>• I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more. (Hebrews 8:10-12)</p>

<p>I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance (Matthew 9:9-13)</p>
<p>Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ (John 3:3-21)</p>
<p>Take my yoke upon you and learn from Me. (Matthew 11:25-30)</p>
<p>Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock. (Matthew 5:1 thru 7:29)</p>
<p>The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things I said to you. (John 13:31 thru 17:26)</p>

<p>All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I command you: and lo, I am with you, even to the end of the age. Amen. (Matthew 28:18-20)</p>
<p>I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. (Matthew chapter 10)</p>
<p>By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. (Matthew 12:33-37)</p>
<p>Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear. (Matthew 13:10-3)</p>
<p>Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. (Acts 13:42-52)</p>
<p>Solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. (Hebrews 5:12 thru 6:3)</p>
<p>What do you wish? (Matthew 20:20-28)</p>
<p>But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless. (I Timothy 3:8-13)</p>
<p>No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you. (John 15:9-17)</p>
<p>This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work. (I Timothy 3:1-7)</p>
<p>The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. (Matthew 9:37&38)</p>
<p>You are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. (I Corinthians chapter 12)</p>
<p>What must I do? Go and do likewise. (Luke 10:25-37)</p>
<p>Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. (James 2:14-26)</p>
<p>Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things. Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high. (Luke 24:44-49)</p>
